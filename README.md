# theCannonGame
<p>Really simplistic game written in exclusively Python for my intro CS class.</p>
I'd say the programming is pretty messy and the game is rather imperfect. Still, it's fun to play if you're really bored...you might be able to beat my high score. I think the most difficult part of this project was getting the physics simulations right...I never realized just how difficult it is.
